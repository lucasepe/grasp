## Create strong passwords using words that are easy for you to remember

A way to circumvent password complexity rules and restrictions while only needing to remember something _memorable_.

## A password manager that does not require any type of storage

Cross Platform simple and secure password generator / manager that does not require a file/cloud/whatever archive.

- [Open Source](https://github.com/lucasepe/grasp)
- Works on [Linux, Mac OS, Windows](https://github.com/lucasepe/grasp/releases/latest)
- Just a single portable binary file

Passwords become complicated (one capital letter, one number, one punctuation mark, one emoji, etc.)...

- It's impossible to use and remember different passwords for all of your accounts?
- You often reuse the same passwords on various accounts?
- Yes! There are a lot of greats passwords managers tools

Using `grasp` all you need to remember are:

> your favorite words! anything that is easy for you to remember! (a poem? a song? a sequence of insults? :bowtie:)

## How to install

### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_it)

```bash
brew tap lucasepe/grasp
brew install grasp
```

## Ready-To-Use Releases 

[Here you can find `grasp` already compiled](https://github.com/lucasepe/grasp/releases/latest) for: MacOS, Linux and Windows.

## How to use (examples)

```
grasp google.com pinco.pallo@gmail.com vercingetorige
>qhOzrL^*+IF
```

```
grasp linkedin.com pinco.pallo@gmail.com hope to find the job of my life!
y@xV4.w$|mIp
```

```
grasp -s L --no-symbols amazon.com leonida@sparta.com this is lambda!
sRZg5qOvK2GnDLJ9
```

Using these parameters `grasp` will generate a password:

- unique, complex and safe
- that meets all validation standards (uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters)

### Who cares... I have a secure online password manager...

Using `grasp` does not stop you from managing your passwords using a secure 'wallet' and in fact <u>this is encouraged</u>. 

What `grasp` gives to you is:

  - a simple way to generate good quality and safe passwords for websites and other services
  - a secure mechanism to retrieve your passwords 
  - an easy system for managing your passwords

:warning: **WARNING!**

> **To recreate the same password for a given account you must make sure you don't forget the original words ​​you used**.
> 
> **If you enter different words, `grasp` will produce a different password! (the order of the words and the difference between upper and lower case is also important)**
  
## How does `grasp` works?

The sequence of words you type after the command is used as salt (the first word) and secret (all remaining words) to generate a secret key using the [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) key derivation function.
 
The result of this encryption is used as key for a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).

Finally the password is composed picking characters, digits and symbols using the integers generated by this CSPRNG.

- all these calculations are done _"on the fly"_ every time you request it 
- this is why `grasp` does not need any archive
